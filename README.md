# milstd1553duino
This project provides a lightweight software implementation of the MIL-STD-1553 data bus protocol, focusing only on the logical layer. It abstracts the physical transport layer, allowing communication over interfaces such as IÂ²C or UART, making it adaptable to different embedded platforms.
